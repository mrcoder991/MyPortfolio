            <p>Photography is basically my hobby. This is the only hobby of mine which I have kept for so long. I mostly shoot with
            phone camera and sometimes with DSLR also but very occasionally, everytime I see a beautiful scenery I quickly pick my
            phone and shoot it.<br> Photography is like capturing memories and special moments to cherish in life. In future when you
            revisit these photos it helps you forget all your stress and think of those precious moments of past. I think
            photography is like time travel you can relive that moment every-time you look back to it.
            I am always very curious about camera technologies and how to use them. I also like videography I often take a pano shot
            of scenes. I post my best photos in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uday_699/" style="text-decoration: none;">Instagram</a> handle you can follow me there.</p>

                <p>Designing and photo editing are one the most wanted skills currently. I was fond of photography from childhood so last
                year I decided to learn photo editing as well. I use Adobe Photoshop for it. Along with this I also know poster making,
                web design and graphics design . I use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign for poster making. For graphics design use
                Adobe illustrator. If you are fond of posting pictures on social media then definitely would love my photo editing.
                sometimes I do media creation also like video and audio editing for that I use Adobe Premiere pro and Audacity.</p>

                <p>As my main profession is software developer and for that I learned most of the popular programming languages like C/C++,
                python, java etc. along with these mainstream programming languages I learned web development as I already know graphics
                design, so I thought why not take it to next level! and I love it. web development includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                which is for frontend of a website and of course this website is made using HTML and CSS. Javascript, Python or PHP is
                used in back end programming. I make beautiful looking websites at a very low cost, feel free to contact me anytime.</p>
